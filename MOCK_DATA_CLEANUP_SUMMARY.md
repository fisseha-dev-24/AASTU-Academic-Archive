- `getTeacherProfile()` - For teacher profile page
- `getDepartmentProfile()` - For department profile page
- `getDepartmentTeachers()` - For department teachers page
- `getTeacherCourses()` - For teacher manage page
- `getTeacherStudents()` - For teacher manage page

## 📊 **Current Progress:**

- **Pages Cleaned**: 4/10 (40%)
- **Pages Remaining**: 6/10 (60%)
- **Mock Data Removed**: ~70%
- **API Integration**: ~60%
