# AASTU Archive - Frontend scaffold

This scaffold creates a React + TypeScript frontend structure for the AASTU Archive System.

Run `python3 create_tree.py` to create the frontend tree under ./frontend with placeholder files.

Next steps:
- Run the script to create files.
- Tell me which file you want me to implement in full detail first (one file at a time). I recommend starting with the color variables and global styles or the Landing page component.
